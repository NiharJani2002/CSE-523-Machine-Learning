# CSE-523-Machine-Learning
I am pursuing Machine Learning Course at Ahmedabad University. This Repository contains the Dataset And Code for the Research Paper to be 
Reproduced During The Course

The article is a comparative study of various activation functions on image segmentation in TensorFlow. The experiments were conducted on two models: 5l_unet and 4l_unet, using different activation functions such as Mexican Relu, Relu, SRS, ISRU, TrainableLeakyRelu, Learnable Swish, Swish, Mish, and Gated Swish. The article provides a link to the dataset used in the study, which is the Data Science Bowl 2018 dataset.
